# Notification System

A flexible notification system for Node.js applications that supports multiple notification channels.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: Main entry point for the application
- `notifications/`: Directory containing notification functionality
- `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `node index.js` to start the application

## Features

- Centralized notification management
- Support for multiple notification types (email, SMS, push, webhooks)
- Easily extensible notification system

## Usage

```javascript
const notificationSystem = require('./index');

// Send an email notification
notificationSystem.send(
  notificationSystem.types.EMAIL,
  'user@example.com',
  'Hello from the notification system!'
);

## Setting Up the Project

To create this project structure on your system:

1. Create a new directory called `notification-system`
2. Create a subdirectory called `notifications`
3. Create the files with the contents provided above:
   - `index.js` in the root directory
   - `notifications/index.js` in the notifications directory
   - `package.json` in the root directory
   - `README.md` in the root directory

Once you've set up these files, you'll have a basic Node.js notification system project structure in place. You can then initialize the project with `npm install` and extend it with additional functionality as needed.
